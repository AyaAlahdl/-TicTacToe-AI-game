# TicTacToe-AI-game
An unbeatable TicTacToe game powered by the Minimax algorithm. Challenge yourself against an AI that never loses!

# Features

- Unbeatable AI: Powered by the Minimax algorithm with optimal decision-making
- Score Tracking: Keeps track of wins, losses, and draws across multiple games
- Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- Beautiful UI: Modern gradient design with glassmorphism effects
- Smooth Animations: Engaging transitions and visual feedback
- Winning Highlights: Winning combinations are highlighted when the game ends
- Smart Turn Indicator: Shows whose turn it is with clear visual cues

# How It Works
The AI uses the Minimax algorithm, a recursive decision-making algorithm that:

- Explores all possible game states
- Evaluates each outcome (win, lose, draw)
- Chooses the move that maximizes its chances while minimizing yours
- Guarantees optimal play (the AI will never make a mistake)

# Algorithm Features

- Alpha-Beta Pruning potential for optimization
- Depth-based scoring for faster wins
- Perfect play guarantee - the AI never loses

# Technologies Used

- React - UI framework
- Lucide React - Beautiful icon library
- Tailwind CSS - Utility-first styling
- JavaScript (ES6+) - Core logic and algorithms

# Installation
Prerequisites

Node.js (v14 or higher)

# How to Play

You play as X (blue) and go first
The AI plays as O (red)

Try to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
The AI will respond with its optimal move
Challenge: Can you force a draw? (You can't win!)
